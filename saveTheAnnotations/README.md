Added a script which can retrieve the Annotation XML file for a given URL or video ID. It's designed to specifically work for Python 3. It can be run from the command line but for those of you who might be interested in getting bots to run you can import saveYouTubeAnnotations.retrieveAnnotation(linkOrId,folderPathToSaveIn) into your own modules.
