# YouTube_Back-up_Tools

Log: 

December 25-25: Added a whole bunch of scripts that can now either individually extract season/episode number or credits on videos or can extract them together with the video's annotations.

December 22: Added a script which can retrieve the Annotation XML file for a given URL or video ID.
It's designed to specifically work for Python 3. It can be run from the command line but for those of you
who might be interested in getting bots to run it you can import `saveYouTubeAnnotations.retrieveAnnotation(linkOrId,folderPathToSaveIn)` into your own modules.
